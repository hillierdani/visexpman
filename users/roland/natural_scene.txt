How to convert the cat natural scenes into mouse natural scenes.
 
Quick answer: for each cat image, scale the image by 6.86/x where x is your microns per pixel ratio of your projector in your setup.
 
Explanation:
 
Data from paper by Betsch et al Biol Cybern 2004 The world from a cat's perspective.
 
Camera 10 mm lens (mounted on cat's head) has a visual angle of 71 degrees Y and 53 degrees X.
 
They sampled at a spatial resolution of 320 x 240 pixels.
 
This gives 4.52 pixels per degree.
 
For the mouse, 1 degree is 31 microns (see paper by Remtulla and Hallett, Vision Research 1985 - see MouseOptics folder on G drive).
 
Then convert this to pixels per degree.
 
You know the microns per pixel ratio for your DLP projector on your setup. Mine is 3.75 pixels per micron.
 
31/3.75 gives 8.27 pixels per degree.
 
Therefore, 8.27/4.52 is 1.83.
 
So you need to scale your cat images by 1.83. Use bicubic interpolation.
 
 
How to make the images (this is how I did it since I didn't work out the scaling factor till later, but probably you can scale directly from the tif files then save as bmps afterwards):
 
First convert the tif files of your favourite cat movie to 8 bit bmps. eg. import image sequence into ImageJ, convert to 8 bit and save as a bmp image sequence.
 
Then import eg 1500 images (you run out of memory if you try to import more) and scale the stack by the scaling factor (control or command E).
 
Save this sequence in the same order as the originals, then do the same for the images after 1500, continuing the sequence.
 
 
For the stimulus file, choose your favourite section of the movie, then make a text file starting from your first image -1 (because it starts at zero in the software) to your last image, with a tab followed by 40.
 
40 is the duration in ms of the movie for each frame, since they sample at a temporal resolution of 25 frames per second, 1000 ms / 25 = 40.
 
You can write this stimulus file eg in mathematica, using /t for new tab.
 
Note: do not name any files with the first letter as n, t or r. This interferes with the software.
 
 
michelef 6.3.2015:
 
in the current cmos-mea-setup 1 pixel = 1.75 um
 
therefore, I have 0.57 pixels = 1 um
 
now, 1 degree is 31 microns in the mouse retina
 
31 deg/um / 0.57 pixels/um gives ~54.4 pixels per degree
 
therefore, 54.4 pixels/degree / 4.5 pixels/degree is ~12
 
So you need to scale your cat images by 12.
Use bicubic interpolation in matlab
 
they sample at a temporal resolution of 25 Hz, 1000 ms / 25 = 40 ms.
 
There should be 40 ms between consecutive frames
